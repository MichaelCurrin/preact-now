# Preact Now Quickstart

This is brief example of a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) app that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

Demo site: 

- https://preact-now.michaelcurrin.now.sh/


## Setup your own

Deploy your own Preact project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples/preact)

That uses the Preact example in the [zeit/now](https://github.com/zeit/now) repo.

Here is their live sample: 

- [preact.now-examples.now.sh](https://preact.now-examples.now.sh)


## Create a fresh project

Use this project as a template

Or get started with Preact for deployment with Vercel, you can use the [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ preact create default my-project
```


## Deploy

### Deploy from your terminal

You can deploy your new Preact project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

```shell
$ vercel
```

Note that this requires registering on the Vercel site and credentials to be setup locally (so only you can deploy to your site).


### Continous deployment

You can use a Github integration to trigger a deploy when a commit appears on Github.
